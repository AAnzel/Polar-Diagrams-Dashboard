Abstract:

> While the polar system may lack the universal familiarity of its Cartesian counterpart, it remains indispensable for certain tasks. Summary polar diagrams, such as Taylor and mutual information diagrams, address tasks like discovering relationships, visualizing data similarity, and quantifying correspondence. Although these diagrams are invaluable tools for uncovering data relationships, their polar nature can hinder intuitiveness and lead to issues like overplotting.
We present a hybrid approach that combines overview+detail, aggregation, interactive filtering, Cartesian linking, and small multiples to enhance the clarity, comprehensiveness, and functionality of summary polar diagrams. We conducted a user study with 21 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. Furthermore, we engaged three domain experts in a pretest review, whose feedback helped refine the approach prior to the user study. Altogether, the results highlight the versatility and benefits of summary polar diagrams by enhancing comprehension and accessibility, addressing challenges, and broadening their utility.

**[1]** Notes on how to download climate data
* The script used for downloading the [data/Case_Study_Climate/](data/Case_Study_Climate/) was generated using the tutorial found here https://esgf.github.io/esgf-user-support/faq.html#how-to-preserve-the-directory-structure
* The script for CMIP5 model data can be automatically re-generated and downloaded using the following link https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/esg-search/wget?download_structure=model&project=CMIP5&experiment=historicalExt&variable=ta&ensemble=r2i1p1&time_frequency=mon.
* The script for observed (reference) data can be automatically re-generated and downloaded using the following link https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/esg-search/wget/?distrib=false&dataset_id=obs4MIPs.NASA-JPL.AIRS-1-0.mon.ta.gn.v20110608|aims3.llnl.gov.

## Running
### Locally
We recommend downloading the repository and running the dashboard locally due to more responsive interactions. After installing the dependencies from the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), the user should run the following commands (Linux):

```bash
cd Polar-Diagrams-Dashboard/src
python app.py
```

The user should then open the link shown in the terminal or open the browser and type the following address: `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.

### Online

The dashboard is also available online at: [https://polar-diagrams-dashboard.onrender.com/](https://polar-diagrams-dashboard.onrender.com/). The online version might not be as responsive which is why we recommend running the dashboard locally using the previously mentioned method.
